In this project, we implemented some metaheuristic algorithms (simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization 2D 3D) to optimize complex functions (ackley, boha1, booth, camel3, ...).

You will find 3 files in Python :
1. Simulated Annealing
2. Particle Swarm Optimization 2D
3. Particle Swarm Optimization 3D
